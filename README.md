# Freshdesk Tickets Creation
This app autopopulates the current ticket data and creates ticket to respective freshdesk account once ticket.save function triggers.
It will check for a specific tag, if the tag is present then it will skip the ticket creation process and will update the status and priority of the future zendesk events in same ticket.
